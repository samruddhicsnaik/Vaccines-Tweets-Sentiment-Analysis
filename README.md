Sentiment Analysis on tweets about COVID-19 vaccines using the fastai library


We will perform sentiment analysis on tweets about COVID-19 vaccines using the fastai library.

Transfer learning in NLP - the ULMFiT approach

We will be making use of transfer learning to help us create a model to analyze tweet sentiment. The idea behind transfer learning is that neural networks learn information that generalizes to new problems, particularly the early layers of the network.

We can use our new classifier to analyze sentiment in the COVID-19 vaccine tweets and compare changes in sentiment over time to the progress of vaccination in different countries.
